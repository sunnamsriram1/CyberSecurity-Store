### **General Questions**
1. What is VAPT, and how does it differ from a vulnerability scan?
2. Can you explain the difference between black-box, white-box, and gray-box testing?
3. What is the purpose of a penetration test report? What are its key components?
4. What is the OWASP Top 10, and why is it important in VAPT?
5. What’s the difference between a false positive and a false negative in vulnerability assessment?

### **Technical Questions**
6. How would you perform a vulnerability assessment on a web application?
7. What tools do you use for VAPT? Explain their use cases (e.g., Burp Suite, Nessus, Metasploit).
8. How do you identify and exploit SQL Injection vulnerabilities?
9. How do you test for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities? 
10. Explain how you would assess the security of APIs.
11. What is the difference between active and passive reconnaissance?
12. How do you perform network penetration testing? Name the tools you use.
13. What is privilege escalation, and how would you identify potential vectors for it?

### **Scenario-Based Questions**
14. You find a critical vulnerability in a client’s application. How would you prioritize and report it?
15. How would you respond if a penetration test accidentally disrupted a production environment?
16. A client insists their systems are secure. How would you convince them of the need for VAPT?

### **Regulations and Standards**
17. What are some industry standards and regulations that require VAPT (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, ISO 27001)?
18. How do you ensure compliance while performing VAPT?

### **Behavioral and Soft Skills**
19. How do you handle disagreements with a client regarding the severity of a vulnerability?
20. How do you stay updated on the latest vulnerabilities and exploits?

### **Advanced Topics**
21. Explain how you’d use CVSS to score vulnerabilities.
22. How do you bypass WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)?
23. Can you explain the concept of lateral movement in penetration testing?
24. How would you chain multiple vulnerabilities to achieve a successful exploit?
25. What is the difference between authenticated and unauthenticated scanning?
