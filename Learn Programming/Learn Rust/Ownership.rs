    Ownership is one of the core concepts in Rust that ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
     It revolves around a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time. The key principles of ownership are:
        1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
        2. There can only be one owner at a time.
        3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
